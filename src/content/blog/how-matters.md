As I'm looking at the world around me, I'm seeing lots of individuals and companies take unsustainable shortcuts in favor of short term gains.

How you do it matters just as much as what you do.

Take professional networking for example, do you show up to events only when you need something like a job or do you show up consistnetly and contribute to the community?

Another example does your organization deeply care about solving the users of your software's problems or do they just want to ship something flashy (maybe AI flavored) to raise their next funding round?

I once worked at a startup and the CEO's departing words really stuck with me. This man was far from perfect (as we all are), but I enjoyed working with him so much that I worked for him a second time and wouldn't hesistate to do it again. Mostly because of our deep alignment on this.

Here's what he said upon his departure.

> As you continue to grow without me, I'd ask you to keep one thing in mind: the way we do it matters. We haven't gotten here because we're the cleverest copywriters, the fastest programmers, or the slickest sales people. We don't work sixteen hour days, and we're not ruthless or cutthroat. We're kind. We care about each other. We bring out the best of each other's strengths, and we bridge each other's weaknesses. We create opportunities to experiment and take risks. We're humble. And we're better for it.

So when you're showing up for work or at a community event in my opinion _how_ you do it matters. In the day and age of social media virality for just a single 20 second video, I know it can be challenging to play the long game...but I encourage you to consider it.

I know I have not regretted my decisions
