## Background

The year is 2024 in the tech industry and layoffs and downsizing are everywhere. It is a very challenging hiring market for job seekers, even software engineers. There are lots of recent code school and computer science degree graduates looking around for their first opportunity to start their career as a software engineer. Amidst this noise, there is also the rise and hype surrounding "generative AI."

## More on Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Perhaps I live in a bubble, but in my world users of software and the participants in various developer communities are tired of hearing about AI and feel like it is being shoved down our throats.

To contast this, I'm seeing two groups of people (sometimes they overlap) that are very excited about AI - people selling things and business executives/investors at various companies.

The peple trying to sell you something's motivations are pretty clear. They want to sell things to make a profit for their business.

The executives/investor's motivations are less clear. Here's my theory: many of them view employing humans as a liability both because dealing with humans can be messy but also because paying them a salary/benefits is expensive and think that AI can be a substitute for this. I won't comment on my opinion of the ethics of this but also, a harsh truth is that many businesses exist to turn a profit and being able to save money by not needing to pay salaries can help move towards this goal.

## My Opinion on AI

I think that these models and tools are quite good, but I don't think they're sophisticated enough yet to fully replace human labor on a wider scale.

In terms leaning more on AI with unvetted AI generated code and shipping it to production, I have concerns over the ability for the remaining human software engineers to be able to effectively troubleshoot and maintain code that they didn't write nor have another software engineer they can turn to who wrote the code to get context.

## My Opinion Ultimately Doesn't Matter

What does matter if you want to be employed in this industry is the opinion of those who are in positions of power that make the budget and hiring decisions.

## Unsolicted Advice

If you want to be hired and maintain a job in this industry as a software engineer, you need to figure out those people in positions of power's motiviations and do the work to be able to effectively and genuinely sell yourself to them.

## Some Ideas

Here's some themes I've seen lately with people in positions of power at various companies lately. Your experience may be different.

1. They want to do more with less

I would advise being curious. When something doesn't work, go down that rabbit hole and be willing to adventure outside of your comfort zone to figure it out and learn new things.

2. They want to deliver solutions

Focus on shipping. It's not enough to just write code anymore, you need to know or which resources to tap in order to be able to get a full working application into production. Be someone who can be trusted to follow through with what you say you will accomplish and deliver.

3. They're excited about AI and some want to replace us with AI because it is cheaper than paying a salary

I would advise investing time in learning and using these new AI tools. Learn what they're good at and use them for that. Learn what they're bad at and invest the time in learning how to do these things well yourself. This is a good way that you can emphasize your value to these executives as to why they should hire you and pay you a salary rather than using AI.

## Closing

Anyway, these are some thoughts I've had over the past few months and wanted to share. Ultimately I'm just another person on the internet with opinions, giving unsolicted advice. What you do or do not do with it is up to you. I welcome polite engaged feedback and conversation on this topic.
