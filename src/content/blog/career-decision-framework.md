## The Framework

"How do you know when it's time to leave your current company?"

This question has come up a few times throughout my career. I don't take it lightly because leaving a company is a big decision. But I've learned that staying in the wrong environment doesn't serve anyone: not me, not my team, and not the company. After years of reflection, I've developed a framework that helps me think through these decisions thoughtfully.

**Disclaimer:** what works for me might not work for you, but I hope sharing it helps you think about what's right for your situation.

My framework is inspired by the iron triangle: fast, cheap, good‚Äîpick two out of three.

For career decisions, my triangle has three sides: what I'm building, who I'm working with, and what tech I'm using.

**My rule üëâüèª I need at least two out of three to thrive at a company.**

**Important context:** This doesn't mean I leave at the first sign of change. Companies evolve, priorities shift, and teams reorganize‚Äîthat's normal. I believe in working through challenges and giving things time to improve. But when fundamental misalignment persists across multiple areas, this framework helps me recognize when it might be time to find a better fit where I can contribute my best work.

Here's what each side means to me üëáüèª

### What I'm Building

I need to feel excited about the product. Does it solve real problems or make the world better? Does it create a delightful user experience?

When I believe in what we're building, I'll push through technical debt, tough sprints, and organizational changes because the mission matters.

### Who I'm Working With

Do my teammates value transparency and create psychological safety where anyone can ask questions? Are they open to feedback rather than defensive during code reviews? Do they advocate for each other and give credit where it's due? Do they care about learning new things and share their knowledge? Are they folks whom I can trust to follow through when they say they will do something?

When I find a team like this, I'll work through product pivots or technical challenges because the people make it worth it.

### What Tech I'm Using

This matters least, but I want to feel excited about the technology. Does it help me solve user problems quickly with a delightful developer experience? Is it reliable, well-maintained, and easy to troubleshoot? Are there good resources when I'm stuck?

I'm pragmatic about tech‚Äîthere's no perfect stack. But working with tools that let me focus on solving problems rather than fighting infrastructure makes a real difference.

## Closing

This framework continues to evolve as I grow, and it's helped me find roles where I can commit deeply and do my best work. Interestingly, it's also helped me recognize when to _stay_ during challenging periods‚Äîif the core alignment is there, it's worth working through temporary difficulties.

I'd love to hear from you! How do you decide when it's time to leave? What makes you want to stay?
