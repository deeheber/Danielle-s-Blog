## The Problem

In many organizations there is friction between building out new features and the foundations necessary to ship those new features. By foundations, I'm referring to things such as but not limited to: security, testing, CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery), observability, and IaC (Infrastructure as Code).

Recently, I was lucky enough to attend AWS re:Inforce, an AWS security focused conference and speaking with fellow attendees it was a common theme and ask of "how can I get people in my organization to care about security?"

Disclaimer that I do not consider myself a security person, but I believe that security is important and champion security initiatives often. Security should be everyone in the organization's responsibility, but sometimes in the real world people get excited about new features and forget about less visible things such as security.

Here are some of my thoughts in the form of unsolicited advice on how I try to navigate this. Sometimes I'm successful and other times I am not, but I refuse to stop trying.

## 1. Just Do It

If you work in an orgnization that gives you the freedom to allocate your time and/or doing some extra security upgrades won't prevent you from delivering on your other tasks, just do it. Then once it's finished, you can share with your team what you did, how it works, and why it's important.

A lot of times it is faster to just do it rather than spend the same amount of time you would doing it asking for permission. Especially at smaller early stage startups, actions and delivering results speaks way louder than words.

## 2. View Yourself as an Enabler

A lot of the time security is (incorrectly) viewed as this thing that slows down feature development. I would advise you flip this script and talk about things such as security as enabling the team to do more.

A lot of security things may not seem important now, but when they become important it is too late. Work towards messaging that encourages being proactive rather than reactive.

A good example of this could be adding security scans to your CI/CD pipeline.

## 3. Learn Incentives

Incentives shape how all of us view the world and rank what is important. Take the time to talk to key stakeholders, specifically those who are in positions of power that get to make the final call on things. Learn what makes them tick and what they care about.

You can then use that information to help shape your positioning when bringing up the need for something that is not a flashy new feature.

## Bonus: Get Involved in the Community

As software professionals, we often work in the silos of our companies. The more I attend in person events and interact with people in the wider industry online, the more I realize that someone else solved the problem I'm currently experiencing. Why not just learn from them and also share my experiences to help others learn? Talk with people to get ideas. Do not be afraid to ask "stupid" questions.

## Closing

At the end of the day, the most important thing when building software is trust. Trust is invisible and often overlooked, but when it's lost it is very hard to gain back. This is highly important when working at an early stage startup that does not have name brand recognition (yet). If your users do not trust you, they will not use your software.

I don't claim to be a security expert, but hopefully at least me making these thoughts public helps someone. At the very least, hopefully it is comforting to know that you aren't alone and that I think your efforts toward security matter. Keep on fighting the good fight.

What are some of your tips/tricks while navigating the friction between features and foundations?
