## The Framework

"How do you know when it's time to leave your current company?"

This question has followed me throughout my career. After years of reflection, I've developed a simple framework that works for me. What works for me might not work for you, but I hope sharing this gets you thinking about what's right for your situation.

My framework is inspired by the iron triangle: fast, cheap, goodâ€”pick two out of three.

// TODO: add image

For career decisions, my triangle has three sides: **what I'm building**, **who I'm working with**, and **what tech I'm using**.

// TODO: add image

My rule: I need at least two out of three to stay at a company.

### What I'm Building

I need to feel excited about the product. Does it solve real problems or make the world better? Does it create a delightful user experience?

### Who I'm Working With

Do my teammates value transparency and create psychological safety where anyone can ask questions? Are they open to feedback rather than defensive during code reviews? Do they advocate for each other and give credit where it's due?

### What Tech I'm Using

This matters least, but I want to feel excited about the technology. Does it help me solve user problems quickly? Is the developer experience delightful? Is it easy to troubleshoot and extend? Are there good resources when I'm stuck? Does it help me build reliable apps? Is it actively maintained with security updates?

## Closing

This framework continues to evolve as I grow. I'd love to hear from you: How do you decide when it's time to leave? What makes you want to stay?
