## The Framework

"How do you know when it's time to leave your current company?"

This question has come up throughout my career. After years of reflection, I've developed a framework that works for me.

Disclaimer: what works for me might not work for you, but I hope sharing it helps you think about what's right for your situation.

My framework is inspired by the iron triangle: fast, cheap, good‚Äîpick two out of three.

For career decisions, my triangle has three sides: **what I'm building**, **who I'm working with**, and **what tech I'm using**.

My rule üëâüèª I need at least two out of three to stay at a company.

Here's what each side means to me üëáüèª

### What I'm Building

I need to feel excited about the product. Does it solve real problems or make the world better? Does it create a delightful user experience?

### Who I'm Working With

Do my teammates value transparency and create psychological safety where anyone can ask questions? Are they open to feedback rather than defensive during code reviews? Do they advocate for each other and give credit where it's due? Do they care about learning new things and share their knowledge? Are they folks whom I can trust to follow through when they say they will do something?

### What Tech I'm Using

This matters least, but I want to feel excited about the technology. Does it help me solve user problems quickly with a delightful developer experience? Is it reliable, well-maintained, and easy to troubleshoot? Are there good resources when I'm stuck?

## Closing

This framework continues to evolve as I grow. I'd love to hear from you! How do you decide when it's time to leave? What makes you want to stay?
