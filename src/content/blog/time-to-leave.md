## The Framework

One topic of conversation that has come up throughout my career has been "how do you know if it is time to leave your current company?"

After spending my entire career thinking about this on and off, I think I've finally come up with a mini framework for myself. Disclaimer that what works for me might not work for you, but my hope in sharing this is that it can get you thinking and reflecting on what is right for you.

My framework is inspired by the iron triangle of service. To recap, you have a triangle with three sides: fast, cheap, and good. You can only pick two out of the three.

So for me, deciding if it is time for me to leave a company, there are three sides: what I'm building, who I am working with, and what tech I'm using.

The main decision factor for me is that I need to have at least two out of the three sides in order to stay at a company. Let's break down these three sides.

### What I'm Building

I need to feel excited about what I'm building. Is it something that addresses a lot of pain points or makes the world a better place? Is it something that provides a delightful user experience?

### Who I Am Working With

Do my teammates value transparency and offer a psychologically safe space where anyone can ask any question while we learn from each other? Are my teammates open to feedback and conversation rather than defensive when I review their code? Are my teammates advocates of each other, freely giving credit where credit is due?

### What Tech I'm Using

This point is the least important of the three, but I also would like to feel excited about the tech that is being used. Does the tech help me quickly solve the end users' problems? Is it a tech stack with a delightful developer experience? Is it easy to troubleshoot and add new features? Are there resources available for when I get stuck on something? Does it help me build robust apps that users can rely on? Is it tech that is still being improved...at the very least has periodic security patches?

## Closing

This is how I've been thinking about this lately, and as I continue to grow, this framework will likely evolve. I would love to hear from you. How are you deciding if it is time to leave your current job? What makes you happy and wanting to stay somewhere?
