description: Danielle answering why she wanted to get a Kubernetes certificate

Earlier this month I took the exam for the <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/kubernetes-cloud-native-associate/" target="_blank">Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA) certification</a> and passed.

As many folks know, I'm widely known for my contributions to the AWS Serverless ecosystem, so naturally I got asked why by many folks in the community.

## Here's my list of reasons why I got this certificate

### 1. I believe in using the best tool for the job

Serverless is amazing. I'm a strong believer in "serverless first", but not "serverless always." There are some instances where using other tools like servers are a better choice for your workload. In terms of container orchestration, I've leaned on AWS ECS/Fargate for this. I was interested in seeing what another non-proprietary container orchestration tool has to offer.

### 2. I wanted a deeper understanding of the systems I use and how they work

Serverless is amazing because it removes the undifferientiated heavy lifting for us. But what if in some cases, we need access to customize beyond what managed services can offer? K8s seems like a natural choice for this.

In comparing K8s to serverless I like to think of it in terms of when your car breaks down. Do you take it to the repair shop and have someone else fix it for you, usually for an added service fee (serverless) or do you pop open the hood, buy the parts, and do the repair yourself (K8s)?

I have an intellectual curiousity to be able to do both.

### 3. Kubernetes is everywhere

Maybe not a great a reason by some standards, but it's inevitable that in a future job I will need to interact with a K8s system. Having baseline knowledge of the basics will help me jump start to be able to get things done faster.

This isn't a value judgement of if all of these companies using K8s actually need to be using it. That is a whole other nuanced conversation that I will not touch here.

## What is the KCNA

You can read all about it on the Linux Foundation website, but to me it was the basic fundamentals of all of the moving parts of K8s, how they interact, and when you would need ot use them.

It was rather surface level and introductory much like I envision the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification is. If you want depth, this isn't the cert for you, but if you want a high level intro this is an excellent choice.

## What Next?

People in the community have been asking if I'm going to become a "Kubernetes person" now. For me the answer is yes and no. I plan to go about this pragmatically and learn enough K8s so I can use the best tool for the job.

In my immediate future I see myself completing the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/extensions/kubernetes-challenge/" target="_blank">Kubernetes Resume Challenge</a> and then going out and building some other personal projects to learn.

I'll be honest and say it's been fun to be a beginner again.
