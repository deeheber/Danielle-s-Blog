Hey, I'm Danielle. I build software and specialize in serverless architecture, but I care just as much about the people and product decisions behind the tech. I write about the real stuff—running cloud infrastructure on a budget, navigating pivotal career decisions, advocating for security work that no one demos in sprint reviews. My work touches technical leadership, developer advocacy, product thinking, and team management.

💻 **What I'm working with:** Serverless, Cloud Infrastructure, Infrastructure as Code, TypeScript, Python, and exploring AI applications in development workflows.

📍 **Find me:** I'm an <a href="https://builder.aws.com/community/@deeheber" target="_blank">AWS Serverless Hero</a> and co-organize the <a href="https://www.believeinserverless.com/" target="_blank">Believe in Serverless Discord community</a>.
