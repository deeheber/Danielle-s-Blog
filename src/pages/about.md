Nice to meet you. ðŸ‘‹

Career wise, I used to work in tech support. I enjoyed helping customers; however, I felt that my job centered around asking engineers to fix bugs.

Because of my desire to provide a better customer experience and to take matters into my own hands, I taught myself how to code and became a software engineer.

This site serves as a personal reminder of my commitment to life long learning, improvement, creating things, and knowledge sharing.
